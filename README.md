## About the Project

The "UofL On-Campus Housing Finder - Cardinal Nest" is an essential project aimed at addressing the challenges that students at the University of Louisville face in finding suitable on-campus housing. The current housing selection process can be fragmented, time-consuming, and stressful for students, particularly those who are new to the university or are unfamiliar with the campus. By creating a centralized digital platform, the project will not only streamline the housing search and application process but also enhance the overall student experience.
